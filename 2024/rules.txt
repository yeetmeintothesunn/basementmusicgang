2024 BasementMusicGang Criteria:
        Collect lists of:
        - Top 10 Albums
          An ordered playlist of 1 song from each album (which you think best represents each album).

        - Top 15 Songs
          An ordered playlist of songs.

        - 5 Weird/Honorable Mentions
          Literally whatever. Albums, songs, tiktok audio snippets, audio recordings of historic naval battles. Anything you want to show off that didn't end up in your tops.

    You only need to have FOUND the music this year (2024). The actual release date of the music can be whenever. If it's new to you this year, it's fair game!

    Music does not need to be all on the same streaming platform, though if it is not I would recommend creating a text file with lists just to help with organization.

    If you have CDs, Tapes, or Records of your music bring them in! We like looking at album art up close!

    If your music is physical release only you might want to rip it to your phone.

    Although we are building lists of 10 albums, 15 songs, and 5 mentions; We'll limit in-person sharing to the Top 5 albums, Top 10 Songs, and a single mention (for time sake). The rest can be checked out individually when I collate all our lists!
